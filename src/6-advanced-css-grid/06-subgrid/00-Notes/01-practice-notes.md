# Practice notes for subgrid

- Check caniuse.com for availability of **subgrid**
- https://caniuse.com/?search=subgrid
- Currently, only Firefox is supporting subgrid.
- So, if you open the same page other than frefox, page will not look good.
- Until, subgrid is supported by all major browsers, use grid inside grid.
- Or, make two style rules. One for firefox(with subgrid) and another for other browsers(grid inside grid)
